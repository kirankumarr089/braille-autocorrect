##Braille Autocorrect

A simple Braille input autocorrect and suggestion tool.
This project assists users typing Braille using a standard QWERTY keyboard by suggesting the closest correct word from a dictionary, even if the input contains mistakes or typos.

    Suggests the most likely intended word based on Braille input with errors.
    Maps QWERTY keys (D, W, Q, K, O, P) to Braille dot positions.
    Easy-to-understand logicâ€”no complex algorithms required.
    Lightweight and fast (written in C++).

##How it Works

Users type Braille letters using specific QWERTY key combinations (e.g., D K|D|D O K for the word "cat").

The program compares the input against a dictionary of valid words.

It calculates the closest match by measuring the number of differences, helping visually impaired users correct their input.

Usage
Compile:
    g++ braille-autocorrect.cpp -o braille-autocorrect

Run:
    ./braille-autocorrect

Enter your Braille input when prompted.
    Example for "cat":
    Input: D K|D|D O
    Output: Did you mean: cat?
